## 10/22/2025 - Brainstorming and research  

I did some brainstorming to get my ideas together on this, and I created an initial plan of what I actually wanted to achieve https://github.com/Something231/Study-Focus-Device/blob/main/plan.md . I also made a initial sketch just to create a basic design for what I wanted to make![initial sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--992c1311d77b96cbd3a29a1b9bdb6d8db0916a51/initial%20sketch.png)

I also did some research for quite a while and investigated that I should probably use a microcontroller for this, and after more research came to the conclusion that using an esp32 would be best. I also looked into how i wanted to do the display and I kind of want to do a led pixel grid type display for this, but most modules i found were expensive so i think i'm going to make it custom into the pcb.  

## 10/24/2025 - More research  

Took quite a while but I did quite a bit of research on how to do a button matrix and led matrix with an esp32, and found some components that seemed like they'd work well for this.

Also installed kicad and figured out how to use the basics of it but didnt really do much pcb design.

## 10/25/2025 - Created a button footprint  

Its not really much progress but it took quite a while to do this, I found a tactile button that I wanted to use from aliexpress and learnt how to make a footprint and symbol for it in kicad, which i havent really used before.

## 10/26/2025 - Designed an led matrix circuit  

Took far longer than it should've but I designed the circuit for both the led matrix and button matrixes in the circuit, and did a lot of research to find the components to do so.
 I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do for power supply and led display.
