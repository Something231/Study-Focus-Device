## 10/22/2025 - Brainstorming and research  

I did some brainstorming to get my ideas together on this, and I created an initial plan of what I actually wanted to achieve https://github.com/Something231/Study-Focus-Device/blob/main/plan.md . I also made a initial sketch just to create a basic design for what I wanted to make![initial sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--992c1311d77b96cbd3a29a1b9bdb6d8db0916a51/initial%20sketch.png)

I also did some research for quite a while and investigated that I should probably use a microcontroller for this, and after more research came to the conclusion that using an esp32 would be best. I also looked into how i wanted to do the display and I kind of want to do a led pixel grid type display for this, but most modules i found were expensive so i think i'm going to make it custom into the pcb.  

## 10/24/2025 - More research  

Took quite a while but I did quite a bit of research on how to do a button matrix and led matrix with an esp32, and found some components that seemed like they'd work well for this.

Also installed kicad and figured out how to use the basics of it but didnt really do much pcb design.
