## 10/22/2025 - Brainstorming and research  

I did some brainstorming to get my ideas together on this, and I created an initial plan of what I actually wanted to achieve https://github.com/Something231/Study-Focus-Device/blob/main/plan.md . I also made a initial sketch just to create a basic design for what I wanted to make![initial sketch.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--992c1311d77b96cbd3a29a1b9bdb6d8db0916a51/initial%20sketch.png)

I also did some research for quite a while and investigated that I should probably use a microcontroller for this, and after more research came to the conclusion that using an esp32 would be best. I also looked into how i wanted to do the display and I kind of want to do a led pixel grid type display for this, but most modules i found were expensive so i think i'm going to make it custom into the pcb.
