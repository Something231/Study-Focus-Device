A study focus device inspired by those focus apps like flora.

Plan:
- To let you schedule study / focus sessions ahead of time using a bunch of buttons in a planner type layout, so you can schedule your sessions ahead of time
- Have it connect to devices via Bluetooth to check if online, so it can check if study is being done with school laptop, or if work is being avoided on a non school device.
- You will gain a daily streak visible on the device by following the hours that you scheduled.
- Each study session can be customized to use pomodoro timings
- Audible alarms to make it clear when things are happening with regard to the sessions
- Matrix display or other display showcasing the time if not in a active study session, or showcasing the time left in study session if in.
- Will be very annoying to you with alarms / lights if you miss the study session, or log onto wrong device during study
- Offline mode as well because not all study is online.
- Streak will contain a high score to make it kinda annoying to miss.
- More planning later
